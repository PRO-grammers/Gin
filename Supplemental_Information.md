Gin

Instructions to play game:
Gin Rummy is a simple card game between two players.
Each player is dealt ten cards. 
The goal is to match up cards in sets and runs, ultimately getting 'Gin' which is when all your cards are matched up in sets and runs. 
Play ends when a player knocks and then points are counted. A player may only knock if the points in his hand sum up to ten or less.
Points are summed up as the face value of all the cards not matched in a set or run.

Supplemental Information:
(a) Design Phase: 15 minutes
    Implementation Phase: 30 hours
(b) This program proved to be more challenging than anticipated, mainly due to our player class.
(c) It was fun working in a group but also frustrating at times due to the wide range of efficiency with c++ that different           members had. But those with more experience helped those with less.
