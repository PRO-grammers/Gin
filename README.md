Gin
===

The Deck class is done!!

Player Class still needs a lot of work. Right now it sorts the hand by suit and value.
We still need to figure out how to find sets and runs.



Instructional Part of ReadMe file:
Gin Rummy is a simple card game between two players.
Each player is dealt ten cards. 
The goal is to match up cards in sets and runs, ultimately getting 'Gin' which is when all your cards are matched up in sets and runs. 
Play ends when a player knocks and then points are counted. A player may only knock if the points in his hand sum up to ten or less.
Points are summed up as the face value of all the cards not matched in a set or run.
